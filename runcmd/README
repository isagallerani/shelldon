OVERVIEW
--------

Libruncmd is a small C library providing some simple functionality specified in
the companion file runcmd.txt.  The file, resented as a man-page like document,
describes the library API.

We are implementing the libriuncmd supplied with POSIXeg as an exercise, completing
the implementation to meet the specification.


INSTRUCTIONS
------------

POSIXeg repository has a test program: test-runcmd. Normally, the default
Makefile rule will build the test-runcm by linking it with the enclosed
libruncmd implementation offered as example. In order to run the test cases
agains your own libruncmd implementation, you may perform the following 
procedure.

Within your project's runcmd directory, build and install the library. 
For instance, if you want to install the library at /home/foo/local

   $ cd <somepath>/myproject/runcmd
   $ make 
   $ make PREFIX=/home/foo/local install

This shall install libruncmd in /home/foo/local/lib

Then, within POSIXeg's runcmd directory

   $ cd <otherpath>/posixeg/runcmd/exercises
   $ make clean
   $ make LDFLAGS="-L/home/foo/local/lib -Wl,-rpath=/home/foo/local/lib" \
          CPPFLAGS="-I/home/foo/local/include"

This will link test-runcmd against your library and set the runtime
limker path (rpath) to look the libraries in the correct location
when the binary is executed. 

Now if you run the test

  $ make test

the test program will test your library, not the library that
comes with POSIXeg.
   

POSIXeg CHANGES AND UPDATES
---------------------------

Eventual changes in POSIXeg such as bug fixes and other improvements may affect
the test programs against which your libruncmd implementation will be evaluated.

Therefore, your are urged to keep an eye on POSIXeg updates during the whole
course of development of your exercise by monitoring the POSIXeg repository at

    https://github.com/SO-II-2017/shelldon

You are also strongly encouraged to report bugs and suggest improvements by 
emailing the authors at 587117@comp.ufscar.br
